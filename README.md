The goal of this project is to create a dynamic and user-friendly mobile and website application for Bom Gosto restaurant. The project will encompass various stages, starting with the development of the back and front end using Django framework, and incorporating a visually appealing design created with Figma. The finalized website will be hosted on pythonanywhere.

This project serves a dual purpose: first, it aims to showcase my proficiency in development and design by demonstrating my skills, thought process, and project structure. Second, it provides a valuable addition to my portfolio, highlighting my capabilities in building responsive applications that enhance the user experience.
